        HTML frames are used to divide your browser window into multiple sections where each section can load a separate HTML document independently. A collection of frames in the browser window is known as a frameset. The window is divided into frames in a similar way the tables are organized: into rows and columns.

        Examples of HTML Frames
Here are some example codes that illustrate how to manipulate frames in HTML.

Creating Frames in HTML
To make frames on a page we use <frameset> tag instead of <body> tag. The <frameset> tag defines how to divide the window into frames. The rows attribute of <frameset> tag defines horizontal frames and cols attribute defines vertical frames. Each frame is indicated by <frame> tag and it defines which HTML document shall open into the frame.

Following is the example to create three horizontal frames. If your browser does not support frames, then body element is displayed.
